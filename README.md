# Stock-Price-Prediction
In today's markets, people generally use income statements, balance sheets and cash flow statements to decide whether or not to invest in stocks. Investors focus on stock's financial behaviors and by using financial statements they try to predict stock price increases. The general question is after the announcement of the financial statement how does the market respond? What does the market think? 
I used annualized financial statements and calculated the most used financial ratios that give general information about the stock. With ratios, I tried to predict next year's price increase or decrease. These ratios include gross profit, ROE, ROA, Net Debt/EBITDA ratio, Current Ratio, Interest Coverage, EBITDA/ total revenue, Earn per share, operating cash flow and EBIT/ total revenue. Using these financial ratios we applied different kinds of machine learning approaches to predict price increases.
